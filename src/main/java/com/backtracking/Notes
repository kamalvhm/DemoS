1) DP(Or Greedy) is used when problems are required to solve optimal solution
2)IN backtracking is used when all possible solution is required.
3) a bounding function is used in backtracking to bound further recurtion if condition fails at any point (isSafe method in N-Queens)

 bounding fails go back  
 
 APPLY BACKTRACKING WHEN YOU NEED ALL POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS (MAY OR MAY NOT BE A CONDITION TO FILTER SOME OF THEM)
