1) Given unsorted array and sum, find minimum length of subarray whose sum is = or > then given target. Example: {1,2,3,4} target 6 === return 2
2) Given scores of the students in 2-D array{name,score}, return max average for any student, it should be floor if average is in decimal.
   Example String[][] arr = {{“a”,”3”}, 
							{“a”,”3”},
							{“a”,”4”},
							{“b”,”2”}}  10/3=3.3 so return 3
